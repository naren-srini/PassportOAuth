# PassportOAuth
OAuth 2.0 on React using Passport Authentication middleware using express.js
In the project directory, you can run:

## Scripts

In the project client directory you can run (DEV):

### `npm start`

Runs the app frontend at development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In the project backend directory you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the Primary Backend Server at Link: [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

## In Production

* Fill out .env file with your secrets
* Make sure all auth providers are setup for http://localhost:4000
* Start ("npm run dev")

## Mongoose Cluster

Simple Guide to create mongoose cluster

* Go to [mongoDB Site](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) 
* Create account and proceed with instructions on site to create organization etc,.
* Create a project with specific name, follow instructions and then open it
* Create a "New Cluster" inside the project by entering the neccessary information
* Open the cluster and click "Connect", and then click "Connect to your Application"
* Change Driver to Node.js > Choose Version (3.6 or later)
* Look up for the uri string (e.g uri=mongodb+srv://your-db-name:<password><your-cluster-name>.mongodb.net/<your-database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
* Copy this from your Mongoose Cluster and store it in your .env file
* When collecting user information from app, go to collections tab in the cluster to view data

## Project Notes
  
  * The Client/Frontend uses React on TypeScript, with State Management using React
  * The Backend uses Express.js (Server + Routing) + Node.js (DB connections)
  * The Authentication is performed using [Passport Strategies] using OAuth (http://www.passportjs.org/packages/) 
  * This project contains Code Analysis that is not required for development (codeql-analysis.yml)
  * .env files are maintained locally.
  * There is a xmldom npm vulnerability (low) that is used in twitter OAuth
  * Use Developer Tools > Console in the web browser to view the data that is sent as json.  
  * Application deployment maybe done using Heroku or Netlify, which I have not done here currently.
